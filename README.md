* Go to the download page for Chrome on the Mac you want to install it on. The site detects that you're using a Mac and automatically suggests the right version for you.

* Click Download Chrome for Mac.

* The installer program for Chrome downloads to your designated Downloads folder. Open the Downloads folder and double-click the file called googlechrome.dmg to launch the installer.

* Drag the Chrome icon to the Application folder icon. The installer will copy Chrome to your computer.

* Before you start using your new browser, clean up the installer files. If you don't, those files will use up space on your hard drive unnecessarily. Open a Finder window and click the arrow next to Google Chrome in the sidebar.

* Return to the Downloads folder and drag googlechrome.dmg to the trash.

* Go to your Applications folder and double-click Google Chrome to start using your new web browser.


## The Benefits of Using Google Chrome on a Mac

Some of the most common and compelling reasons people prefer to use Chrome include:

* Chrome ties into the Google ecosystem: You can sign in to your Google account using Chrome and use all the services and data in your Google account, right there in your browser. If you're a heavy user of Google services, Chrome is the simplest and best-integrated way to access them.


* Chrome is highly compatible: Although it doesn't happen much these days, some sites won't load or function correctly in Safari. In those situations, you might have better luck with Chrome.


* Chrome is available on many platforms: Because it comes from Apple, Safari is available only on Macs and iOS devices (it comes installed on the iPhone and iPad, too). Apple used to offer Safari for Windows but discontinued that version in 2012. Chrome, however, runs everywhere: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, and more.


* Chrome has a massive library of extensions: You can expand your browser's functionality by installing extensions. Safari supports extensions, too, but Chrome has a much bigger selection. With over 10,000 extensions available for Chrome, you can add a huge array of features, including ad-blocking, web developer tools, and more.
